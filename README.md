# 🦆 Welcome to PowerDuckie

**Cute Outside. Powerful Inside.**

PowerDuckie is a developer-first platform that automatically scans your codebase to extract APIs — then lets you debug, document, mock, automate, and ship them with minimal manual work.
Think: **no more manually filling request parameters like Postman**. Scan once, everything about your API (endpoints, params, request/response shapes) is discovered and usable immediately.

Although designed with SaaS-level polish, PowerDuckie’s standout promise is **offline-first collaboration**: it stores data on the local filesystem and integrates with `git` (CLI + built-in Git UI) so teams can work fast, securely, and reproducibly.

---

## 🚀 Overview

PowerDuckie turns your code into a living API workspace. It parses your repositories (local or mounted), extracts endpoints and types, generates editable docs and mocks, and provides a powerful playground for debugging and automating API workflows — all while keeping your data where you want it: on disk and under Git.

Perfect for engineering teams, platform engineers, API-first shops, and developers who want the convenience of a modern API platform without sending source or schema data to the cloud.

## 💡 Why PowerDuckie?

* 🔍 **Automatic API discovery** — scan your codebase; PowerDuckie finds endpoints, parameters, and request/response structures so you don't have to type them in.
* 🛠️ **From code → docs → tests → CI** — a single source of truth that flows through debugging, documentation, mocking, automation, and CI/CD.
* 🗄️ **Offline-first, local storage** — your API definitions and data live on the local filesystem; ideal for privacy-sensitive teams and air-gapped environments.
* 🌿 **Git-native collaboration** — continue using `git` the way you do: commit, branch, diff. Or use the built-in Git UI for visual collaboration.
* ⚡ **Developer-friendly** — fast scans, intuitive UI, scriptable API, and integrations to fit existing workflows.
* 🔮 **Roadmap** — automatic test-case generation from scanned code (coming soon).

## 🧰 Key Features

* **Automatic Code Scanning & API Extraction**
  Parse server code (multiple languages/frameworks supported) to extract routes, HTTP methods, parameters, schemas, and example payloads — automatically.

* **Instant API Playground & Debugger**
  Launch requests against local or remote services with extracted parameters pre-filled. Inspect headers, cookies, streaming responses, and RTT metrics.

* **Docs Generation & Publishing**
  One-click generate human-readable API docs from scanned definitions. Docs are editable, versioned with Git, and exportable.

* **Mock Server Generation**
  Generate mocks from discovered response shapes. Run mocks locally or as part of CI to decouple frontend and backend development.

* **Automation & CI/CD Integrations**
  Turn API definitions into automated workflows: contract checks, smoke tests, mock-driven pipelines, and deployment gates. Export CI-ready artifacts or plug into existing pipelines.

* **Local-first Storage + Git Collaboration**
  All project data is stored in a configurable local directory (filesystem-backed). Changes are plain files — diffable, mergeable, and version-controlled using your existing Git workflow or PowerDuckie’s built-in Git UI.

* **Extensible & Scriptable**
  CLI + REST API for automation, plugin hooks to extend parsers, and templates for custom docs, mock rules, and test generation.

* **Security & Privacy Controls**
  Full offline operation, configurable data retention, and explicit Git commits for sharing changes — no hidden sync or telemetry.

* **Planned: Auto Test-Case Generation**
  Soon: intelligent generation of unit/integration test cases from extracted API definitions and code paths.

## 🪶 Philosophy

PowerDuckie is built on three simple beliefs:

* **Trust the code.** Source is the ground truth — extract APIs directly from it.
* **Keep control local.** Teams should choose where their API schemas and metadata live.
* **Make engineering joyful.** Dev tools should be efficient and a little delightful.

> Small tool. Mighty power.
> Cute outside. Powerful inside.

## 🔁 Collaboration & Git Flow

* Workspace files are plain, human-editable artifacts (YAML/JSON + small meta files).
* Use your regular Git workflow: branches, pull requests, diffs, merges.
* PowerDuckie UI provides a visual Git client for staging, committing, diffing, and resolving simple conflicts.
* Ideal for pair-programming, code reviews that include API changes, and audit trails.

---

## 🛡️ Security & Privacy

* **Offline-first:** runs without outbound network access (optional integrations can be enabled).
* **Local storage:** all definitions and mocks are stored in your filesystem under the configured workspace.
* **Explicit sharing:** Git pushes or exported bundles are the only way to share workspace state.
* **Enterprise-ready:** policy hooks and SSO integrations are available for on-prem / private deployments.

Would you like me to:

* expand this into a full multi-section README (Installation, Supported Frameworks, Workspace File Format, Examples, API Reference),
* or produce sample workspace files and a demo repo structure to ship with the project?
